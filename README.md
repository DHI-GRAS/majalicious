# maja-symlink-guy

Run MAJA on Sentinel 2 data by creating a lot of symlinks


## Purpose

This little script automates the processing of Sentinel 2 timeseries with MAJA.
It indexes by date all L1C and MAJA-produced L2A products in the folders you provide
and creates symlinks to the ones MAJA needs to run in L2NOMINAL or L2BACKWARD mode.

This way, you e.g. always have the most recent L2A product for the current L1C product
you are processing and you do not need to move any files around when starting to process
a new scene.


## Building

```bash
docker build -t maja
```

## Running

To see the full interface, run

```
bash docker run maja
```

For an actual run, you need to mount the input and auxillary data 
into the docker container.
The default is that you have, inside the container, a folder `/maja-aux`
with the following contents:

```
/maja-aux
  userconf
  GIPP
  DTM/{tile}
```
If you follow this pattern, you can omit the `--src-userconf`, `--src-gipp`, and `--src-dtm` flags. 

Furthermore, you need to provide a `--src-input` directory that contains your `.SAFE` input files
and a `--dst-output` directory for the L2A output.

The `--dst-work-root` directory must be inside the container (i.e. not on a mounted resource) for 
the symlinking to work.

A full example command is the following:

```bash
docker run -v /my/maja/aux:/maja-aux -v /my/maja/data:/maja-data maja --src-input /maja-data/input --dst-output /maja-data/output --tile 32UNG
```
